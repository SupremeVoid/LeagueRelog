# LeagueRelog 0.1

A way to startup the League of Legends client with a Server selected before starting the client.
This safes time and since it only changes the server not the language used it stops the client from patching 1GB of data every time you relog e.g. from NA to EUW.

## How to use

Simply start the LeagueRelog.exe from anywhere on your system.
If you dont have League of Legends installed in the default directory a Dialog will open which lets you navigate to your League of Legends installation.
Select the LeagueClient.exe in this dialog. 
Type 'path' if to change the path of the LeagueClient.exe

To start League of Legends with one of the three options (EUW, NA or EUNE) simply type:
'1' or 'EUW'
'2' or 'NA'
'3' or 'EUNE'

Type 'q' to exit the program
